# How to use
## Keybind
### Initially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default. Go to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default C) isn't conflicting (goes red).

## Open settings menu
### You can access the settings menu with two ways.

- The client command /zoomify
- Mod Menu settings button
